Premise:
Sonos Wireless Home Wifi for under Â£40.
Use cheap, easy-to-obtain hardware to stream Spotify tracks to each room in your
house. Built to be ported to Raspberry Pi (eventually).

A work in progress.

First iteration (see: /cfhack/) built with love (and tears) at the Cardiff
University "Open Sauce" Hackathon, March 10th - 11th 2012
(http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/hackathon/). Executed on a IGEPv2 single-board
computer (ARM TI OMAP3530 CPU) running Debian Squeeze (via Emdebian Grip).
